## Library Preparation and Sequencing
The 16S PCR targeted the V3-V4 region, Bakt_341F and Bakt_806R [@klindworth2012evaluation].
The V3-V4 target region is `r 805-341` bp, with forward and reverse reads overlaping by `r 600 - (805-341)` bp [@yang2016sensitivity] ( http://probebase.csb.univie.ac.at) (__TODO__ Supplemental Figure Amplicon Region).
The primer sequences include additional overhang adapter sequences to facilitate library preparation (5'- TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG - 3') and reverse primers (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC).

The 16S targeted PCR was performed according to the Illumina protocol using the KAPA HiFI HotStart ReadyMix reagents (KAPA Biosystems, Inc. Wilmington, MA).
The resulting PCR product was verified using agarose gel electrophoresis.
Next the PCR product was purified and concentration was assessed using picogreen ( __Reagent Info, plate reader info__). 
After purification the 192 samples were indexed using the Illumina Nextera XT index kits A and D (Illumina Inc., San Diego CA).
The indexed PCR products were again purified and concentration was assessed using picogreen ( __Reagent Info__).
The purified sample concentration was normalized using SequalPrep (ThermoFisher, Waltham MA), according to the manufactuers protocol and pooled prior to sequencing.
Due to low concentration of the pooled amplicon library the follow method was used __TODO__.
The library was run on a Illumina MiSeq and base calls were made using Illumina Real Time Analysis Software version 1.18.54.
