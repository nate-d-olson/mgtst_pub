## Library Preparation and Sequencing 
The 16S PCR targeted the V34 region, Bakt_341F and Bakt_806R [@klindworth2012evaluation]. The V34 target region is `r 805-341` bp, with forward and reverse reads overlaping by `r 600 - (805-341)` bp \@ref(fig:rra_diag) [@yang2016sensitivity] ( http://probebase.csb.univie.ac.at). The primer sequences included additional overhang adapter seuqences to facilitate library preparation (5'- TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG - 3') and reverse primers (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC). 

The reaction was performed according to the Illumina protocol using the KAPA HiFI HotStart ReadyMix reagents (KAPA Biosystems, Inc. Wilmington, MA). 
The resulting PCR product was then verified using gel electrophoresis. 
Next the PCR product was purified and concentration was assessed using pico green ( __Reagent Info, plate reader info__). 
After purification the 192 samples were indexed using the Illumina Nextera XT index kits A and D (Illumina Inc., San Diego CA). 
The indexed PCR products were again purified and concentration was assessed using pico green ( __Reagent Info__). 
The purified sample concentration was normalized using SequalPrep (ThermoFisher, Waltham MA), according to the manufactuers protocol and pooled prior to sequencing. 
Due to low concentration of the pooled amplicon library the follow method was used __[TODO]__.... 
The library was run on a Illumina MiSeq and base calls were made using ___[TODO]__....
