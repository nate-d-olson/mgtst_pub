# Count Table Value Analysis  
See `artifacts/count_values.pdf`

- Overall Bias and Variance Summary  
- features only in Pre and post unmixed  
- effectiveness of high and low variance replicates __Not sure what I meant here__
- Correlating factors with feature level normalization performance
      - factors: well position, primer mismatches, GC, high level taxonomic group (gram positive vs. gram negative) 
      - Potentially test for a phylogenetic signal?
