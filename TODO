Next Steps
==========

* workout story  

* outline discussion  

* outline introduction  

* qualitative analysis
      - monte-carlo bayesian sampling analysis for mix and unmixed specific features, Use a monte-carlo distribution to look at EO metric values of -1, where the expected count values are 0. bayesian assume different prior between some value and 0 to get a likelihood, then test likelihood....

* Revise feature selection for quantitative analysis  
    - subset features with > log2 fold change between pre and post  
    - MA plots by pipeline and biological replicate

* draft theta:t_fctr bias and variance section 
      - model demonstration/ validation  

* PrePost Bias Variance results
      - volcano plot - Mean est - cov est plot - faceted volcano plot, interested in deviation from 0 
      - outlier features, specifically E. coli biological replicate 38, Want a wat to connect lines in estimate plot with feature level bias and variance 
      - Correlate bias and variance metric with log2 fold-change  

* Submit data to SRA

NOTES
* Libraries no longer automatically loaded with project template - DESeq, DESeq2, edgeR, phyloseq, Rqc, savR, vegan, sads


Note from chat with Hector
look at est_div_theta as input proportion of the feature  



use variance of estimates for comparison

var b1/theta != var(b1)/theta^2
dont have same variance
 
normalize by z-score, to remove theta


T-value
b1/sb(b1)


Only look at higher theta titrations

b1/theta = post - pre
expectation same Z-score for non-intercept (T20) estimates
For simulated data - sanity check 
Plot (post-pre) * theta vs. b1 form count ~ TF
