Next Steps
* draft EO metric section
      - test for EO metric by biosample and pipeline
      - binomial test for proportion - 0 observed counts, and 0 expected counts 
      
* draft theta:t_fctr bias and variance section 
      - model demonstration/ validation  

* seq qa figure 
      - merge into single figure    
      
* metric methods section  
      - EO metric
      - binomial test 
            - EO -1  

* phylogenetic signal analysis
      - review literature
      - phylogenetic trees
      - phylogenetic analysis  

* workout story  
* outline discussion  
* outline introduction  


## Call follow-up
* Use a monte-carlo distribution to look at EO metric values of -1, where the expected count values are 0.  
      * bayesian assume different prior between some value and 0 to get a likelihood, then test likelihood....
* Use a linear model to estimate theta for a titration 
* Look into outlier features more, specifically E. coli biological replicate 38 
* Mean est - cov est plot - faceted volcano plot, interested in deviation from 0  
* Want a wat to connect lines in estimate plot with feature level bias and variance

* Libraries no longer automatically loaded with project template - DESeq, DESeq2, edgeR, phyloseq, Rqc, savR, vegan, sads


Note from chat with Hector
look at est_div_theta as input proportion of the feature 
use variance of estimates for comparison

var b1/theta != var(b1)/theta^2
dont have same variance
 
normalize by z-score, to remove theta


T-value
b1/sb(b1)


Only look at higher theta titrations

b1/theta = post - pre
expectation same Z-score for non-intercept (T20) estimates
For simulated data - sanity check 
Plot (post-pre) * theta vs. b1 form count ~ TF
