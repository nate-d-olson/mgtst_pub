Dealing with NTC

## Meeting with Hector Follow-up 10/19/2017
* calculate negative binomial logFC estimates 
* Theta corrected log fold-change expected values  
* Test for pipeline and estimator effect on error bias (slope) and variance (R2)
* log fold-change estimate sensitivity using PCR replicates
      * TP - log fold-change for PCR combinantions between titrations 
      * FP - log fold-change for PCR combinations within titrations 
            * Include terms in model for PCR plate and plate half
      * for edgeR - feature dispersion is the variance estimate
