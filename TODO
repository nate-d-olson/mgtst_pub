* Libraries no longer automatically loaded with project template - DESeq, DESeq2, edgeR, phyloseq, Rqc, savR, vegan, sads


Note from chat with Hector
look at est_div_theta as input proportion of the feature  

use variance of estimates for comparison

var b1/theta != var(b1)/theta^2
dont have same variance
 
normalize by z-score, to remove theta


T-value
b1/sb(b1)


Only look at higher theta titrations

b1/theta = post - pre
expectation same Z-score for non-intercept (T20) estimates
For simulated data - sanity check 
Plot (post-pre) * theta vs. b1 form count ~ TF
