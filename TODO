## Artifacts
* sample selection/ experimental design
* wetlab qa and titration validation
* seq data qa
* pipeline results characterization
* count table value analysis - bias-variance and feature exploration
* log fold-change analysis - bias-variance and feature exploration


## Analysis
* Standardize pData for MRexperiments (see 2017-02-01-log-fold-change-df.Rmd for code)
* Move mrexp to ProjectTemplate
* Move permutation code to ProjectTemplate
* Dilution permutations
* Move differential abundance calcs to ProjectTemplate - code to src, and tidy tables to data cache
* Look into titration comparisons where MgSeq failed (see 2017-02-01-log-fold-change-df.Rmd)
* Plot coefficient of variation to explore measurement assessment variation 
* Check if `round(0)` is needed for `mgseq_to_deseq2`
* Check if edgeR `x <- x +1` is needed 
* MA plots   
      - Subject   
      - consistency for unique OTUs - check for expected values - plot all in light grey then color unique features, using means for log-fold change
      - looking at both OTUs and taxonomy
* Look into low dsq and dsqlog count cv.
