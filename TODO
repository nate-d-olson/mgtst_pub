Dealing with NTC

ERCC qPCR
-----------------------------------------------------
* Use a mixed effects model to account for qPCR plate effects   
* Add test (t-test) to test whether slopes are significantly different from expectation (1,-1)  
* Compare model fix results for different titration subsets (only relevant to support conclusions regarding titration specific differences.)



NOTES
=======================================================
* Libraries no longer automatically loaded with project template - DESeq, DESeq2, edgeR, phyloseq, Rqc, savR, vegan, sads


Note from chat with Hector
look at est_div_theta as input proportion of the feature  



use variance of estimates for comparison

var b1/theta != var(b1)/theta^2
dont have same variance
 
normalize by z-score, to remove theta


T-value
b1/sb(b1)


Only look at higher theta titrations

b1/theta = post - pre
expectation same Z-score for non-intercept (T20) estimates
For simulated data - sanity check 
Plot (post-pre) * theta vs. b1 form count ~ TF
