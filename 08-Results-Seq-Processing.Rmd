## Sequence Processing

### Pipeline characteristics
* Section objectives
      * make non-quantitative statements
      * capturing differences in quality across samples
* Characterization of different pipelines
      - number of clusters
      - different taxonomic assignments
* Statements/ Figures showing how datasets behave
* number of assigned vs. non-assigned
* __TODO__ difference in richness
      * need to figure out how I want to normalize/ transform the data prior to calculating diversity values
* number of features found across samples and replicates
* __TODO__ Table - pipeline sequence budget
      - number of reads filtered due to low quality
      - number of reads merged
      - number of chimeras
