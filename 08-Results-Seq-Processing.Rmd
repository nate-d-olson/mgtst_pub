## Sequence Processing
* Characterization of different pipelines
      - number of clusters
      - different taxonomic assignments
* Statements/ Figures showing how datasets behave
* number of assigned vs. non-assigned
* difference in richness
* make non-quantitative statements
* capturing differences in quality across samples
* number of features found across samples and replicates
* Table - pipeline sequence budget
      - number of reads filtered due to low quality
      - number of reads merged
      - number of chimeras
