## Index Reaction
* Reaction information 

## Sample Selection

## wetlab QC

* sample concentration results summary

## Seq data QA

* number of reads
* read length distributions
* PhiX error rate analysis
* base quality summary 

## Pipeline 

* Seq budget - summarize fate of sequences, number successful merged read pairs, chimera filtered, alignment?, ect.
    * Table - pipeline sequence budget
        * number of reads filtered due to low quality
        * number of reads merged
        * number of chimeras

## Characterizing Sources of variability
### Response Variance
* Experimental replicate variance - how is the variance correlated with different types of technical replicates, how does the variance differ for pipelines
    * section objective - characterize count variance between PCR replicates  
        * is the variance correlated with experimental values e.g. biological sample, PCR plate, well, sequencing depth, or observed count value  
    * Figure - relationship between count and PCR replicate variance
    

### Response linearity 
* section objective - demonstrate how the dataset is used to characterize relative abundance estimates and identify potential sources of bias
* Figure observed vs expected plots
* Figure representative OTUs showing different types of response linearity
* Differentiating between high and low linearity OTUs
