## Sample Selection
Five biological replicates from the ETEC vaccine trial were selected based on the absence of detectable _E. coli_ in the pre-treatment sample and the post-treatment sample with the highest abundance of _E. coli_ measured using qPCR and 16S rRNA metagenomics [@pop2016individual] \@ref(fig:experimenta_design).
Due to limited material availability for biological replicate E01JH0016, post-treatment day 1 was used instead of day 2.
For biological replicate E01JH0017, there was a discrepancy between the maximum abundance post-treatment time point between the qPCR and 454 data.
The post-treatment time point with the maximum qPCR abundance value was used in this study.
