A number of unmixed- and titration-specific features were observed (titration-specific: Fig. \@ref(fig:qualPlot)A, unmixed-specific: Fig. \@ref(fig:qualPlot)B).
There were unmixed-specific features with expected counts that could not be explained by sampling alone for all individuals and bioinformatic pipelines (Fig. \@ref(fig:qualPlot)C).
However, the proportion of unmixed-specific features that could not be explained by sampling alone varied by bioinformatic pipeline.
DADA2 had the highest rate of unmixed-specific features not explained by sampling whereas QIIME had the lowest rate.
Consistent with the distribution of observed counts for titration-specific features more of the DADA2 features could not be explained by sampling alone compared to the other pipelines (Fig. \@ref(fig:qualPlot)D). Overall, DADA2 resulted in the largest number of observed features inconsistent with the titration experiment design, while the same phenomenon is significantly reduced in the other pipelines.
