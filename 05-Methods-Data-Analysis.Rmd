## Data Analysis
All data analysis was performed using the statistical programming language R (REF) and the RStudio IDE (REF). 
Initial quality assessment of the sequence files (fastq) was performed using the Bioconductor package Rqc (REF). 

## Measurement Assessment 
* Variance
* Bias
      * expectation calculation

* Normalization Methods
      * None
      * TSS - total sum scaling
      * CSS - cumulative sum scaling
      * Senthil's method
      * rarefaction
      * square root transformation - AIST spike-ins
      * Holmes arcsin transformation

##  log-fold Change Assessment
* Variance 
* Bias 
      * expectation calculation
* Differential Abundance Methods
      * metagenomeFeatures
      * DESeq
      * EdgeR
