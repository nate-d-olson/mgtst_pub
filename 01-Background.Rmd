# Background
* General Introduction
      * Microbiome and 16S metagenomics
      * Differential abundance and normalization  
           - Role of normalization in addressing biases, e.g. differences in sequencing depth and sample coverage  

      * Connection between 16S and RNAseq  

* Use of mixtures for RNAseq validation   
      * Complexity of real samples  
      * Provides a level of truth  

* Assessing normalization and differential abundance  
      * Current approaches, and limitations  
      * Bias-variance trade off  

* Study objectives  
      * Demonstrate how mixtures can be used for 16S  
      * Generate a dataset for use in evaluating 16S  
      * Develop methods for assessing normalization and differential abundance
