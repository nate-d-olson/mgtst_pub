# Background
* General Introduction
      * Microbiome and 16S metagenomics 
      * Differential abundance and normalization  
      * Connection between 16S and RNAseq
* Use of mixtures for RNAseq validation  
      * Complexity of real samples  
      * Provides a level of truth  
* Study objectives  
      * Demonstrate how mixtures can be used for 16S  
      * Generate a dataset for use in evaluating 16S  
      * Develop methods for assessing normalization and differential abundance
