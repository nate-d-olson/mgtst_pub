# Methods
## Experimental Design

## Two-Sample-Titration Design  
Samples from a vaccine trial were selected for use in the study [@harro2011refinement]. 
Five trial participants were selected based as thoes with no _Eshechichia coli_ detected in stool samples before exposure to Enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ (ETEC)) and timepoints with the highest concentration of _E. coli_ after exposure [@pop2016individual].
For the two-sample titration post-treatment samples (stool samples collected after exposure to _E. coli_ ETEC) were titrated into pre-treatment samples (stool samples collected _before_ exposure to _E. coli_ ETEC) with $log_2$ changes in pre to post sample proportions \@ref(fig:experimenta_design) (Panel B).

### Titration Validation
* ERCCs were spiked into mixtures for use in QC.  
      * ERCC plasmid prep   
      * ERCC qPCR assay information  
* Bacterial DNA concentration

## Sample Processing Workflow
The resulting 45 two sample titrations were processed using a standard 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing workflow based on the Illumina 16S library protocol (REF). 
The protocol consisted of an initial 16S rRNA PCR followed by a seperate sample indexing PCR. The concentration of the resulting indexed 16S PCR products were normalized using the SequalPrep Normalization Plate Kit(Catalog n. A10510-01, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) then pooled and sequenced on a single Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) run. A total of 192 samples were sequenced including four PCR replicates of each of the 45 mixtures and 12 no template controls \@ref(fig:experimental_design). 
The samples were distributed across two 96 well plates with the two plates serving as technical replicates. 
* Multiple laboratory information
