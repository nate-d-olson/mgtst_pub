Characteristics of features for use in evaluating how consistent count values are with the expected values:

Reasons for features not being consistent with expections
1. Clustering/ pipeline artifacts - biologically unrelated sequences grouped together 
2. Proportion of bacterial DNA from pre- and post-treatment samples is not consistent with our expectations 
3. Sequence specific artifact, e.g. GC bias, primer binding, organismal diversity (how conserved is the 16S gene), copy number, 


1. Expected count value - are the values near the LOD?
2. How many observed titration replicate counts are 0? 
3. R^2
4. Optimal distance
