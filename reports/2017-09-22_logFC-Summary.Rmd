## Objective
Based on the mixture design the logFC between sequential titrations for features only present in post-exposure samples should be 1. 
Due to differences in the proportion of bacterial DNA the expected logFC of 1 does not hold. 
However, the logFC between sequential titrations should be constant and increase when comparing non-adjacent titrations. 

## Approach
* Characterize observed logFC between pre- and post-exposure samples for E01JH0011. This individual had inferred theta values that agreed best with the mixture design. 

## Post-specific features
Most of the post-specific features were not present in none of the titrations and therefore cannot be used to evalute logFC estimates. 
Interestingly there was no correlation between logCPM between the pre- and post-exposure samples and the number of titration PCR replicates with observed counts. 
For post-specific features we expect a linear relationship between the logFC estimate and difference in the titration factor for the samples being compared. 
For features with high abundance in the post-exposure samples (large logCPM) observed in over half of the titration PCR replicates there is inconsistent behavior even for the highest abundance (logCPM > 6.5) and prevalent features (observed in > 15 titration PCRs). 

```{r fig.cap = "Distribution titration PCR replicates with non-zero counts for post-specific features."}
pa_summary_anno_df %>% 
      filter(biosample_id == "E01JH0011", T00 == 4, T20 == 0) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_histogram(aes(x = pa_mixed)) + facet_wrap(~pipe, nrow = 1) + 
      theme_bw() + 
      labs(x = "Titration PCR Replicates with Non-Zero Counts")
```

```{r fig.cap = "Relationship between the logFC pre- and post-exposure samples of post-specific features to the number of titration PCR replicats the feature was observed in."}
logFC_biosam_11 %>% 
      filter(T1 == 0, T2 == 20, post_specific == 1) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_point(aes(x = pa_mixed, y = logCPM)) + 
      facet_wrap(~pipe) + theme_bw() + labs(x = "Number of Titration PCR Replicates")
```

```{r}
post_feature_logFC <- logFC_biosam_11 %>% 
      filter(T1 == 0, T2 == 20,
             post_specific == 1, pa_mixed != 0) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      select(pipe, biosample_id, feature_id, logCPM, logFC) %>%
      rename(prepost_logCPM = logCPM, prepost_logFC = logFC) %>% 
      left_join(logFC_biosam_11)
```



```{r fig.cap="logFC estimates between the first titration and titrations 2-5 for high abundance and prevalent post-specific features."}
post_feature_logFC %>% ungroup() %>% 
      filter(pa_mixed > 15, prepost_logCPM > 6.58)  %>% 
      filter(T1 == 1, T2 %in% 1:5)  %>% 
      ggplot() +
      geom_point(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, color = pipe)) + 
      geom_line(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, group = feature_id)) + 
      facet_wrap(~feature_id) + 
      theme_bw()
```
## Escherichia/ Shigella Features 
logFC estimates for features classified as Escherichia with logFC > -4 between unmixed pre- and post-exposure samples exhibited the expected behavior of linearly increasing when comparing non-successive titrations. 

```{r fig.cap = "MA plot comparing pre and post unmixed E01JH0011 samples. Teal points indicates features classified as Escherichia."}
logFC_biosam_11 %>% filter(T1 == 0, T2 == 20) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_point(aes(x = logCPM, y = logFC, 
                     fill = factor(ec_feature)), 
                 color = "grey80", shape = 21) + 
      geom_hline(aes(yintercept = -4), linetype = 2) + 
      facet_wrap(~pipe) + theme_bw()
```

No QIIME features were classified as __Escherichia/Shigella__, will include QIIME features classified as Enterobacteriaceae with logFC < -4. 
```{r}
logFC_biosam_11 %>% filter(Rank5 == "f__Enterobacteriaceae") %>% 
      filter(T1 == 0, T2 == 20) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_point(aes(x = logCPM, y = logFC), 
                 color = "grey80", shape = 21) + 
      geom_hline(aes(yintercept = -4), linetype = 2) + 
      facet_wrap(~pipe) + theme_bw()
      
```


Subset of Escherichia features that are well behaved. 
```{r}
logFC_biosam_11 %>% 
      mutate(ec_feature = if_else(Rank5 == "f__Enterobacteriaceae", 
                                  "escherichia",ec_feature)) %>% 
      filter(T1 == 0, T2 == 20, pa_mixed != 0, 
             ec_feature == "escherichia", logFC < -4) %>% 
      group_by(pipe) %>% 
      top_n(n = 4, wt = logCPM) %>%
      select(pipe, biosample_id, feature_id, logCPM, logFC) %>%
      rename(prepost_logCPM = logCPM, prepost_logFC = logFC) %>% 
      left_join(logFC_biosam_11) %>% 
      filter(T1 == 1, T2 %in% 1:5) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_path(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, group = feature_id)) + 
            geom_point(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, color = prepost_logFC)) + 
      theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~pipe, nrow = 1)
```



## Other Post-Dominant Features
As __Escherichia__ was not a post-specific feature but was significantly more abundant in post-exposure samples than pre-exposure samples we looked at the logFC between the first titration and the second - fifth titrations. 
Overall the logFC values are not consistent with our expectations or with other feature with similar pre- post logFC characteristics. 
Though feature behavior is not always consistent with our expectations.

```{r}
other_features_logFC <- logFC_biosam_11 %>% 
      filter(T1 == 0, T2 == 20,
             post_specific != 1, 
             pa_mixed != 0, 
             ec_feature != "escherichia",
             logFC < -4) %>% 
      ungroup() %>%
      select(pipe, biosample_id, feature_id, logCPM, logFC, pa_mixed) %>%
      mutate(pp_logCPM_bin = cut_number(n = 4, logCPM),
             pa_mixed_bin = cut_number(n = 4, pa_mixed)) %>%
      rename(prepost_logCPM = logCPM, prepost_logFC = logFC) %>%
      left_join(logFC_biosam_11)
```

```{r}
other_features_logFC %>%
      ungroup() %>%
      filter(T1 == 1, T2 %in% 1:5)  %>%
      group_by(feature_id) %>%
      mutate(med_logFC = median(logFC),
             range_logFC = max(abs(logFC)) - min(abs(logFC))) %>%
      filter(med_logFC != 0, range_logFC > 1) %>% 
      ggplot() +
      geom_point(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, color = pipe)) +
      geom_line(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, group = feature_id)) +
      theme_bw()  + facet_wrap(~feature_id)
```

## Characterizing Feature Behavior
To determine whether logFC value are inconsistent with our expectations or due to varaiablity in the measurement process we characterized features based on prepost_logFC, prepost_CPM, pa_mixed, linear model for T1 = 1 and T2 = 1:5 - R2 and slope. 

```{r}
logFC_model_dat <- logFC_biosam_11 %>% 
      ## Only including features with significant pre-post differential abundance estimates
      filter(T1 == 0, T2 == 20,pa_mixed != 0, FDR < 0.05) %>% 
      ungroup() %>%
      select(pipe, biosample_id, feature_id, logCPM, logFC, pa_mixed, post_specific) %>%
      rename(prepost_logCPM = logCPM, prepost_logFC = logFC) %>%
      left_join(logFC_biosam_11) %>% 
      filter(T1 == 1, T2 %in% 2:5)

## fitting a linear model to the logFC between the first titration and titrations 2-5. 
logFC_model_fit <- logFC_model_dat %>% 
      mutate(T2 = as.numeric(as.character(T2))) %>% 
      group_by(pipe, feature_id, prepost_logFC, prepost_logCPM, pa_mixed) %>% 
      mutate(mean_logFC = mean(logFC)) %>% 
      ## excluding features with no change between titrations - all logFC 0 most
      ## likely 0 abundance features
      filter(mean_logFC != 0) %>% 
      nest() %>% 
      mutate(fit = map(data, ~lm(logFC~T2, data = .)),
             fit_glance = map(fit, glance),
             fit_tidy = map(fit, tidy))

logFC_lm_glance <- logFC_model_fit %>% select(-data, -fit, -fit_tidy) %>% unnest() %>% 
      select(-p.value, -statistic)

logFC_lm_df <- logFC_model_fit %>% select(-data, -fit, -fit_glance) %>% unnest() %>% 
      left_join(logFC_lm_glance) %>% 
      mutate(term = if_else(term == "(Intercept)", "intercept", "slope"))
```

High R2 values tend to increase as slope estimates get further from 0. 
```{r fig.cap = "Relationship between R2 and slope estimates."}
logFC_lm_df %>% filter(term == "slope") %>% 
      ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = estimate, y = adj.r.squared)) +
      theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + facet_wrap(~pipe) +
      labs(x = "Slope Estimate")
```


No clear relationship between pre-post logFC or logCPM and slope estimate or R2. 
```{r}
logFC_lm_df %>% filter(term == "slope") %>% 
      ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = estimate, y = adj.r.squared, color = prepost_logFC)) +
      theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + facet_wrap(~pipe) +
      scale_color_gradient2() + labs(x = "Slope Estimate")
```


```{r}
logFC_lm_df %>% filter(term == "slope") %>% 
      ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = prepost_logCPM, y = adj.r.squared)) +
      theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + facet_wrap(~pipe)
```

For features with high R2 > 0.75, there are peaks in the slope estimates around 0.25 and -0.5.
Assuming the pre- and post-exposure samples were mixed according to the experimental design a slope of 1 is expected. 

```{r}
logFC_lm_df %>% filter(term == "slope", adj.r.squared > 0.75) %>% 
      ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = estimate)) +
      theme_bw() + 
      theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
      facet_wrap(~pipe, ncol = 1) + 
      labs(x = "Slope Estimate")
```


```{r}
lm_feature_subset <- logFC_lm_df %>% filter(term == "slope") %>% 
      filter(adj.r.squared > 0.75, estimate < -0.25) %>% 
      select(pipe, feature_id) %>% 
      left_join(logFC_model_fit) %>% 
      select(-fit, -fit_glance, -fit_tidy) %>% 
      unnest()
```

logFC estimate performance is independent of pre-post logFC and pre-exposure sample abundance. 
Though a large logFC and starting relative abundance are necessary to detect changes in relative abundance across titrations. 

Escherichia/Shigella, Ruminoccocus, Sulfovibrioaceae are the only taxa that has consistent behavior across pipelines.
```{r}
lm_feature_subset %>% 
      mutate(Rank3 = str_replace(Rank3, "c__",""),
             Rank4 = str_replace(Rank4, "o__",""),
             Rank5 = str_replace(Rank5, "f__",""), 
             Rank6 = str_replace(Rank6, "g__","")) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_line(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, group = feature_id)) + 
      geom_point(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, color = Rank6)) +
      facet_grid(Rank5~pipe) + 
      theme_bw()
```

```{r}
lm_feature_subset <- logFC_lm_df %>% 
      filter(term == "slope") %>% 
      filter(adj.r.squared > 0.75, estimate < -0.35, estimate > -0.65) %>% 
      select(pipe, feature_id) %>% 
      left_join(logFC_model_fit) %>% 
      select(-fit, -fit_glance, -fit_tidy) %>% 
      unnest()
```

Some features with negative slope estimates but positive pre-post logFC estimates, these are inconsistent with expectations. 
```{r}

      filter(term == "slope") %>% 
      filter(adj.r.squared > 0.75, estimate < -0.35, estimate > -0.65) %>% 
      select(pipe, feature_id, prepost_logFC, prepost_logCPM, 
             pa_mixed) %>% 
      gather("key","value", -pipe, -feature_id) %>% 
      ggplot() + geom_density(aes(x = value, color = pipe)) + 
      facet_grid(pipe~key, scales = "free_x") + theme_bw()
```

```{r}
lm_feature_subset %>% 
      mutate(Rank3 = str_replace(Rank3, "c__",""),
             Rank4 = str_replace(Rank4, "o__",""),
             Rank5 = str_replace(Rank5, "f__",""), 
             Rank6 = str_replace(Rank6, "g__","")) %>% 
      ggplot() + 
      geom_line(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, group = feature_id)) + 
      geom_point(aes(x = T2, y = logFC, color = Rank6)) +
      facet_grid(Rank5~pipe) + 
      theme_bw()
```

      filter(adj.r.squared > 0.75, estimate > 0.15, estimate < 0.35) %>% 
      select(pipe, feature_id) %>% 
      left_join(logFC_model_fit) %>% 
      select(-fit, -fit_glance, -fit_tidy) %>% 
      unnest()
```

```{r}

             pa_mixed) %>%

## Regression Tree
Interested in the relationship between logFC, logCPM, and number of titration PCR replicates with observed counts to the linear model fit - R2 and slope estimate.
```{r}
logFC_lm_anno <- logFC_lm_df %>% 
      filter(term == "slope")
```

Looking at features with negative slope estimates first
```{r}
library(rpart)
fit <- rpart(estimate ~ prepost_logFC + prepost_logCPM + pa_mixed, 
             data=logFC_lm_anno %>% filter(estimate < 0))
```

```{r}
printcp(fit)
```

```{r}
plotcp(fit)
```

Not sure what to make of results.  
Seems as though prepost_logFC is the primary driver of the groups. 
```{r}
plot(fit, uniform=TRUE); text(fit, use.n=TRUE, all=TRUE, cex=.8)
```
Features with positive slope estimates
```{r}
library(rpart)
fit <- rpart(adj.r.squared ~ estimate + prepost_logFC + prepost_logCPM + pa_mixed, 
             data=logFC_lm_anno %>% filter(estimate > 0))
```

```{r}
printcp(fit)
```

```{r}
plotcp(fit)
```

```{r}
plot(fit, uniform=TRUE); text(fit, use.n=TRUE, all=TRUE, cex=.8)
```

### Next Steps
* Determine the relationship between feature characteristics and linear model fit. Characteristics defined as presence/ absence and pre-post logFC
How to present these results? 
Can/Differentiating between poor logFC results due to pipelines and wet lab sample processing. 

## im-proptu meeting with Hector
* Look at samples where theta estimates are generally consistent with expectation
* Compare logFC change between titrations 1 and 3 for the unclustered dataset to expected value of -2 (logFC error)
* Relate logFC error to logCPM
* Expand to compare logFC error for other titration comparisons
