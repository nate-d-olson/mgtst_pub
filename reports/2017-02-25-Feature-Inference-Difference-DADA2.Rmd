## Objective 
A relatively low number of inferred features per samples identified using the sequence inference pipeline (DADA2) relative to the open-reference clustering (QIIME) and de-novo clustering (Mothur) pipelines. 
This low number of inferred features could be due to grouping sequences that are representative of distinct biological units. 

## Approach
To evaluate the composition of sequences in the DADA2 features
1. investigate the within cluster pairwise sequence distances
2. characterize the distribution of sequences assigned to a feature across titrations, the assumption is that unrelated sequences will have different distributions.
