Two sets of quantitative PCR experiments were used to validate the titrations. 
ERCC exogenous spike-ins were used to validate the proportion of DNA from the unmixed pre- and post-treatment samples in the titrations. 
A 16S rRNA bacterial qPCR assay was used to evaluate the proportion of bacterial DNA in the titrations from the unmixed pre- and post-titration samples.  

# ERCC Spike-in qPCR

__Methods__  

- Fit standard curve data to a linear model to assess assay precision ($R^2$) and efficiency.  
- Efficiency, is a measure of the assay amplification efficiency, whether the amount of template DNA doubles every PCR cycle.  

__Results__  

- The qPCR assay standard curves had a high level of precision with $R^2$ values close to 1 for all standard curves (Table \@ref(tab:erccStdCurve)).  
- The amplification efficiency was outside of the ideal range (0.9 - 1.1), but within the acceptable range (0.8-1.2).  
    - Ideal and acceptable ranges based on rule of thumb community accepted guidelines.  

- The post treatment qPCR assays had good $R^2$ and slope values (Table \@ref(tab:erccTitrationCurve)). The expected slope is 1, for a doubling every cycle.  
    - The 1-4 titration factor samples had Ct values consistently above the regression line (Figure \@ref(fig:erccPlot)).  
    - Different slopes for titations 1-4 and titrations 0, 5, 10, and 15 (Table \@ref(tab:erccPostFit)).  

- For the pre-treatment samples, should be 1 Ct difference between the unmixed post and titration factor 1 and 0.5 Ct between titration factor 1 and 2.  
    - For the other titration factors the expected difference is to small to detect using qPCR (< 0.5 Ct).  

__Discussion__  

- Limitation of efficiency assessment is that the standard curve is only plasmid DNA, no stool DNA as background. Stool DNA may contain PCR inhibitors or DNA that may interfere with the qPCR assay.

# Bacterial Concentration qPCR

__Methods__  

- Fitting the standard curve to a linear model, `Ct ~ log10(concentration)`.  
- The expected slope for the standard curve is -3.33 indicating a perfect doubling every PCR cycle, for a amplification factor ($AF = 10^{ -1/slope}$) of 2 and efficiency ($E = 10^{ -1/slope} - 1$) of 1.  
- Used an in-house standard curve, due to issues related to the stability of the manufacturer provided standard. (Supplmental material??)  
- The model was fit using the full standard curve and only points in the standard curve with concentrations greater than 0.02 ng/ul.   
    - Fitting the regression to all concentrations in the standard curve resulted in a lower amplification efficiency and $R^2$.   

- Used a linear model to test for differences in the bacterial DNA concentration between titrations. No difference between titrations indicates that the proportion of bacterial DNA in the pre- and post-treatment unmixed samples is the same. 

- As the post-treatment bacterial DNA concentration estimates are outside of the standard curve. The post-treatment sample bacterial DNA concentration was also estimated using concentration estimates for unmixed pre-treatment samples. $Post = \frac{Con - (1-\theta)Pre}{\theta}$

__Results__   

- The concentation of bacterial DNA is greater in the post-treatment samples than the pre-treatment samples for all biological replicates excluding 4 __TODO-Use JH- ID system__ (Figure \@ref(fig:bacPrePost)).   
- The post-treatment DNA concentration estimates are greater than the expected value of 12.5 ng/ul and outside of the standard curve for all but sample 4 __TODO-Use JH- ID system__ (Figure \@ref(fig:bacPrePost)).  
    - The unmixed sample concentrations were diluted to 12.5 ng/ul prior to making the titrations therefore all samples are expected to have concentrations less than 12.5ng/ul.  

- Figure \@ref(fig:bacTitrations)  
    - For biological replicates 1 and 4 higher bacterial DNA concentration for titrations 5, 10, and 15 compared to titrations 1-4.  
    - For biological replicate 3 and 5 the concentration of bacterial DNA decreases with titration.  
    - Biological replicate 2 __NOT SURE HOW TO INTERPERET__  

- Figure \@ref(fig:postConcEst)  
      - Post-treatment sample concentration estimates are less than 0 for most biological replicates and titrations.  
      - Either the math is wrong, the qPCR measurements are not accurate enough for these calculations, or the samples are not mixed according to expectation.
